#### Eclipse Contributor Agreement

Before your contribution can be accepted by the project team, you must electronically sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php).

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/eclipse-tradista/tradista/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/eclipse-tradista/tradista/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* Use the bug report template to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Ensure to use the Eclipse default formatting style (*"Eclipse [built-in]"*) for your code and open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. 

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Eclipse Tradista will generally not be accepted, the reason is that there are a lot of hidden cost in addition to writing the code itself for such changes and priority is given to bug fixes and new features.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change opening an issue (please use the feature request template). The feature request will be considered and you will receive a feedback on it.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Eclipse Tradista in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-tradista/tradista/discussions) of the tradista repository.

Eclipse Tradista is a volunteer effort, your contributions are gladly welcomed !

Thanks!
